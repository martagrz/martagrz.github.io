My interests lie at the intersection of economics and machine learning. My work aims to understand and model the underlying mechanisms of choice and decision-making behaviour, accounting for dynamic settings, across a range of environments. To this end, I combine and develop tools and techniques in a variety of areas such as microeconomic theory, game theory, algorithms, machine learning and data science.

I am a Founder of a company that seeks to develop and apply algorithms for understanding and modelling consumer behaviour in industry settings. We are currently looking for design partners in the supermarket and airline space to develop our proof of concept.
