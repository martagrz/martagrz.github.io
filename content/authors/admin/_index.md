My research interests lie at the intersection of economics and machine learning. My work aims to understand and model 
the mechanisms underlying choice and decision-making processes, combining aspects of economic theory with modern 
computational methods. This is applicable to a range of environments, including choice under uncertainty, 
inter-temporal decision-making and multi-agent interactions. To this end, I combine and develop tools and 
techniques in a variety of areas such as microeconomic theory, dynamic programming (reinforcement learning) and 
machine learning.

In September 2024, I will be joining St John's College, University of Cambridge, as a College Associate Lecturer and 
Fellow in Economics.

I am also a founder of a tech start-up focusing on developing consumer behavioural models across a range of verticals.
